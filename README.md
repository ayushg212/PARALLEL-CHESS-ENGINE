## Rules of Chess
Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board. Each player controls 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is under threat of capture with no legal moves to escape.

## Basic Rules:
1. Starting Position: The game begins with pieces arranged in a specific layout on the board.
2. Turns: Players alternate turns, with White moving first.
3. Piece Movement:
    - Pawn: Moves forward one square, with the option to move two squares on its first move. Captures diagonally.
    - Rook: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
    - Knight: Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.
    - Bishop: Moves diagonally any number of squares.
    - Queen: Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.
    - King: Moves one square in any direction.
4. Special Moves:
   - Castling: A move involving the king and a rook that has not yet moved.
   - En Passant: A special pawn capture.
   - Promotion: When a pawn reaches the far end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king).
5. Check and Checkmate: If a king is in a position to be captured (in check), it must move out of check. Checkmate occurs when a king is in check 
     with no legal moves to escape.
